TypeScript type definitions for HERE maps JavaScript API
============================
As HERE maps doesn't provide TypeScript type definitions for the JavaScript API, this PHP script may help you. The script requests the online docs and generates a d.ts file. Feel free to use it or use the ready here-maps.d.ts file. I hope, here maps will provide typings by themselves in the future (I have contacted their support a while ago).
